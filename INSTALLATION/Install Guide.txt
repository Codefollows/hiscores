How to install (roughly):

Step 1: Setup a database
Go to your website cPanel and find "MySQL Databases" and enter this. Here you
need to create a new database, username with a unique password, then assign the
user to the database. Everything should be in order.

KEEP NOTE OF WHAT YOU ENTER HERE. Write it down or save to a text file.

==================================

Step 2: Importing the SQL File
Next, go back in to your cPanel main page and find "phpMyAdmin", this will open
a new window. Once it's loaded, find the newly made database on the left side then
click it. Across the top on the right section, click import and select the
included SQL File. Click the button at the bottom to import it.

==================================

Step 3: Setting up the Website
Make sure you've uploaded the hiscores to your desired folder, then proceed to
the "assets" folder. Find the file called "constants.php"; This is where all of your
configuration settings are. Edit the info as needed using the database info you
made in Step 1.

==================================

Step 4: Adding server code
Add the included .java file into your server project via Eclipse IDE (or your
favorite editor). Fix the imports as necessary and edit the SQL info at the top.
You will then need to edit the SQL info in the Java file.

The HOST option should be your website ip address. Open your website cPanel and
search for "Server Information". It should be listed next to either a "Dedicated IP"
or "Shared IP Address".

Everything else should match the configuration you entered in Step 1 or Step 3.

================================== 

Step 5: Running the Code
To run the code, you only need to add 1 line to either login/logout method (or however
you choose to do it, but those are my preferred ways):

new Thread(new Highscores(player)).start();
==================================

Troubleshooting Steps:
1.) If anything fails to load, please make sure your SQL info is correct in
constants.php then try reloading the page.

2.) Make sure that you've imported the included SQL file into the database you
made in step 1. This will cause the page to partially load if the SQL file isn't
imported. (May stop loading entirely)

3.)If all else fails, try going to "Select PHP Version" in cPanel and set it to
either 5.5 or 5.6. This should not break anything else but may be required for the
hiscores to work properly.

4.) If you are missing methods server-side, you will have to make them yourself.
The naming of the methods should make it obvious as to what they are for.
